							<h4>HISTORY</h4>
							 Jaipur is the famous city and capital of Rajasthan. It was founded on 18 November 1727 by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II, the ruler of Amber, after whom the city has been named. Jaipur is known as the Pink City of India because of the colour used exclusively in the walled city.
							 The capital of Rajasthan, Jaipur is rich in history and culture. Here the past comes alive in magnificent forts and palaces. The bustling bazaars of Jaipur, famous for jewellery, fabric and shoes, possess a timeless quality and are surely a treasure-trove for the shoppers.
